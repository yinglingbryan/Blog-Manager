# Blog Manager Package for Concrete5

This custom package adds the ability for CMS admins to post and edit blog posts directly to the frontend using a user-friendly Wyziwig editor.  The manager is directly added to the Concrete5 dashboard so that the client can manage their own blog posts directly.  It includes a "latest posts" block that can be added to any page to show the 3 most recent blog posts with thumbnails and brief summaries of content.

Additionally, an individual page is dynamically generated for each blog post with a custom "pretty url", which increases web crawler indexing and boosts SEO for the website.  Has the ability to specify categories, authors, and thumbnail images for each blog post.

This Blog manager is a stand-alone plugin for Concrete 5 and is currently being used at https://mghus.com/blog and https://mycvl.com/blog.
